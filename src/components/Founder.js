                <h1>Hi, I am Pritika,</h1>
                <h1>Founder of Fitmom.club</h1>
                <p>
                I am committed to achieving weight loss 
                through a balanced and nutritious diet that 
                does not ask you to sacrifice tasty food.
                 I have noticed 
                 that many women, like myself, often 
                 overlook their health while juggling 
                 the responsibilities of being a mother
                  and fulfilling various roles. However
                  , through my own experiences and 
                  interactions with other women, I have
                   realized the importance of addressing
                    our health concerns. After becoming 
                    a mom, I faced several health issues,
                     including postpartum weight gain, 
                     which prompted me to embark on a 
                     journey towards a healthier lifestyle
                     . Recognizing the changes my body 
                     underwent during pregnancy, I made 
                     a committed decision to regain my 
                     energy and vitality. This marked 
                     the beginning of my transformative 
                     journey in becoming a more energetic
                      version of my pre-pregnancy self. 
                      Thus began my transformative journey.
